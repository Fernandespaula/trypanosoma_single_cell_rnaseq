Trypanosoma brucei:

9 samples from 10xGenomics, indrop and smartseq2, from our lab and other groups.
(more details of each sample in singlecell_rnaseq_projects directory)


reference genome: GTF created in our lab, extended 3' UTRs and addition of mVSGs - version in use: gtfv8.8, genome fasta file from trypdb with mVSGs added.
(in ref_genome_tbrucei directory)

goals: 
-Use cellranger, starsolo and salmon alevin in order to get the best out of the sequencing data. 
-Integrate datasets to make a life cycle atlas.
-Compare scRNAseq to bulk RNAseq
-Possibly compare in vitro and in vivo data.
